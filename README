NAME
    MooseX::WhatTheTrig - what attribute triggered me?

SYNOPSIS
       use v5.14;
   
       package Goose {
          use Moose;
          use MooseX::WhatTheTrig;
      
          has foo => (
             traits  => [ WhatTheTrig ],
             is      => 'rw',
             trigger => sub {
                my $self = shift;
                my $attr = Moose::Util::find_meta($self)->triggered_attribute;
                say "Triggered $attr";
             },
          );
       }
   
       my $obj = Goose->new(foo => 42);    # says "Triggered foo"
       $obj->foo(999);                     # says "Triggered foo"

DESCRIPTION
    Moose trigger subs get passed two (sometimes three) parameters:

    *   The object itself.

    *   The new attribute value.

    *   The old attribute value (if any).

    The sub doesn't get told which attribute triggered it. This may present a
    problem if you wish to have the same coderef triggered from several
    different attributes.

    This module adds a `$meta->triggered_attribute` method to your class'
    metaobject, which allows you to check which attribute has been triggered.

    Yes, it works if you trigger one attribute from another attribute.

    Yes, it works in roles.

    Yes, it works with inheritance.
